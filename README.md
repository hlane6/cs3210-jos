This is a unix like baby operating system implemented in an exokernel fashion.
It was a semester long project in my Operating Systems class at Georgia Tech
(cs3210) based off of the MIT 6.828 class. A lot of code was provided
to us, but much was written by me. Hopefully, if time allows, I can accomplish
my goal of porting it to ARM and getting to boot on a Raspberry Pi.
