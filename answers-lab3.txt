2.)
You have to make the pagefault vector require
privelege 0 so that only the kernel can access
it. If a user tries to invoke it, it should just
be a general fault saying that a user can't do
that. Otherwise, a user could invoke the kernel's
page fault handler and pass in some malicious 
value into kernel code that could do bad things
inside the kernel.

3.)
Since this breakpoint is called using the int
instruction, you have to set the privelege 
level to 3 so that users can call int and it
be mapped to the breakpoint trap number.

4.)
So that user programs don't have access to all
traps and would be able to access certain parts
of the kernel that we may not want them to have
access to. It's simply another level of protection
from user environments.

I implemented a step monitor command. It allows you
to step through a user enivornment, by setting the 
cpu into single step mode when going back into the
user enivornment. The cpu just execute a single
intruction and then put a trap instruction so that
it goes back into the kernel code again.
