1.)
Not necessary to disable A20 in mpentry.
mpentry also has to use MPADDRPHYS because it will link the
address at the wrong place since it thinks it is where the boot
loader goes but it actually somewhere else

2.)
While not impossible, without multiple kernel stacks, the locking
mechanism of the kernel would be much more difficult to implement.
It would be more error prone and slower, so multiple kernel stacks
helps in that regard.

3.)
Since e is in the kernel space, and every process has the same
mappings for the kernel space, every page directory will map 
to the same physical address for the variables in kernel space.

4.)
It's saved in the traphandler when the stack is made to look like
a trapframe. Then when env_run happens, the trapframe values are 
used to restore the environments registers.
