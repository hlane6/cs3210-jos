No, since the eflags is saved whenever yielding or 
running environments, it will be properly stored
or restored whenever changing environments.

Challenge
====================
I implemented an eviction policy for the block cache.

Most of the code for the actual eviction algorithm
can be seen in fs/fs.c under the functions try_to_evict
and handle_block.

The algorithm is simple and uses the PTE_A flag in 
the file system environments page tables. The idea is
to evict the least recently accessed block. It loops
through every block and tries to find a block that
doesn't have its access flag marked. As it searches,
it will mark blocks that have the access flag marked
as unmarked. If it goes through once without finding
a block, it will search once again, now guaranteed to
find a block to evict.

A system call was also added to remove the access flag
for a given page since it would not be allowed with the 
current form of sys_page_map.
